    <p class="CHORUS">CHORUS. May all good fortune prosper you,
    May you have health and riches too,
    May you succeed in all you do!
    Long life to you—till then!</p>

    SOLO—POOH-BAH.

    As in a month you've got to die,
    If Ko-Ko tells us true,
    'Twere empty compliment to cry
    "Long life to Nanki-Poo!"
    But as one month you have to live
    As fellow-citizen,
    This toast with three times three we'll give—
    "Long life to you—till then!"

    Pooh-Bah.</p>

    SOLO—KATISHA.

    The hour of gladness
    Is dead and gone;
    In silent sadness
    I live alone!
    The hope I cherished
    All lifeless lies,
    And all has perished
    Save love, which never dies!
    Oh, faithless one, this insult you shall rue!
    In vain for mercy on your knees you'll sue.
    I'll tear the mask from your disguising!

    <h6 class="NANK name">NANK.</h6> <p class="direction">(aside).</p> Now comes the blow!
    <h6 class="KAT name">KAT.</h6>Prepare yourselves for news surprising!
    <h6 class="NANK name">NANK.</h6> <p class="direction">(aside).</p> How foil my foe?
    <h6 class="KAT name">KAT.</h6> No minstrel he, despite bravado!
    <h6 class="YUM name">YUM.</h6> <p class="direction">(aside, struck by an idea).</p> Ha! ha! I know!
    KAT. He is the son of your——

    <p class="direction">(Nanki-Poo, Yum-Yum, and Chorus, interrupting, sing Japanese words,
    to drown her voice.)</p>

    ENSEMBLE.

    <h6 class="NANKI-POO name">NANKI-POO.</h6> The threatened cloud has passed away,
    <h6 class="YUM name">YUM.</h6> And brightly shines the dawning day;
    <h6 class="NANKI-POO name">NANKI-POO.</h6> What though the night may come too soon,
    <h6 class="YUM name">YUM.</h6> There's yet a month of afternoon!

    NANKI-POO, POOH-BAH, YUM-YUM, PITTI-SING,
    and PEEP-BO.

    Then let the throng
    Our joy advance,
    With laughing song
    And merry dance,
    TRIO

    With endless schemes If I allowed A gentleman
