     <h4>The Mikado</h4>
     <h6>
          ACT I <br>
          SCENE.—Courtyard of Ko-Ko's Palace in Titipu. Japanese nobles<br>
          discovered standing and sitting in attitudes suggested by<br>
          native drawings.<br>
     </h6>
     <p>
          Enter Ko-Ko.

     <h6>KO.</h6> <p>(looking after Yum-Yum). </p>There she goes! To think how
     entirely my future happiness is wrapped up in that little parcel!
     Really, it hardly seems worth while! Oh, matrimony!— <p>(Enter
     Pooh-Bah and Pish-Tush.)</p> Now then, what is it? Can't you see I'm
     soliloquizing? You have interrupted an apostrophe, sir!
     <h6>PISH.</h6> I am the bearer of a letter from his Majesty the
     Mikado.
     <h6>KO.</h6> <p>(taking it from him reverentially).</p>A letter from the
     Mikado! What in the world can he have to say to me? <p>(Reads
     letter.)</p> Ah, here it is at last! I thought it would come sooner
     or later! The Mikado is struck by the fact that no executions
     have taken place in Titipu for a year, and decrees that unless
     somebody is beheaded within one month the post of Lord High
     Executioner shall be abolished, and the city reduced to the rank
     of a village!

     Enter Nanki-Poo.

     <h6>NANK.</h6> Yum-Yum, at last we are alone! I have sought you
     night and day for three weeks, in the belief that your guardian
     was beheaded, and I find that you are about to be married to him
     this afternoon!
     <h6>YUM.</h6> Alas, yes!
     <h6>NANK.</h6> But you do not love him?
     <h6>YUM.</h6> Alas, no!
     <h6>NANK.</h6> Modified rapture! But why do you not refuse him?
     <h6>YUM.</h6> What good would that do? He's my guardian, and he
     wouldn't let me marry you!
     <h6>NANK.</h6> But I would wait until you were of age!
     <h6>YUM.</h6> You forget that in Japan girls do not arrive at years
     of discretion until they are fifty.
     <h6>NANK.</h6> True; from seventeen to forty-nine are considered
     years of indiscretion.


     Enter Ko-Ko and Pooh-Bah.

     <h6>KO.</h6> At last, my bride that is to be! <p>(About to embrace
     her.)</p>
     <h6>YUM.</h6> You're not going to kiss me before all these people?
     <h6>KO.</h6> Well, that was the idea.
     <h6>YUM</h6> <p>(aside to Peep-Bo).</p> It seems odd, doesn't it?
     <h6>PEEP.</h6> It's rather peculiar.
     <h6>PITTI.</h6> Oh, I expect it's all right. Must have a beginning,
     you know.
     <h6>YUM.</h6> Well, of course I know nothing about these things; but
     I've no objection if it's usual.
     <h6>KO.</h6> Oh, it's quite usual, I think. Eh, Lord Chamberlain?
     <p>(Appealing to Pooh-Bah.)</p>
     <h6>POOH.</h6> I have known it done. <p>(Ko-Ko embraces her.)</p>


     Enter Pooh-Bah.

     <h6>KO.</h6> Pooh-Bah, it seems that the festivities in connection
     with my approaching marriage must last a week. I should like to
     do it handsomely, and I want to consult you as to the amount I
     ought to spend upon them.
     <h6>POOH.</h6> Certainly. In which of my capacities? As First Lord
     of the Treasury, Lord Chamberlain, Attorney General, Chancellor
     of the Exchequer, Privy Purse, or Private Secretary?
     <h6>KO.</h6> Suppose we say as Private Secretary.
     <h6>POOH.</h6> Speaking as your Private Secretary, I should say
     that, as the city will have to pay for it, don't stint yourself,
     do it well.
     <h6>KO.</h6> Exactly—as the city will have to pay for it. That is
     your advice.
     <h6>POOH.</h6> As Private Secretary. Of course you will understand
     that, as Chancellor of the Exchequer, I am bound to see that due
     economy is observed.


     Enter Chorus of Nobles.

     Behold the Lord High Executioner
     A personage of noble rank and title—
     A dignified and potent officer,
     Whose functions are particularly vital!
     Defer, defer,
     To the Lord High Executioner!

     Enter Ko-Ko attended.

     SOLO—KO-KO.

     Taken from the county jail
     By a set of curious chances;
     Liberated then on bail,
     On my own recognizances;
     Wafted by a favouring gale
     As one sometimes is in trances,
     To a height that few can scale,
     Save by long and weary dances;

     SONG and CHORUS—NANKI-POO.

     <p>A wandering minstrel I—
     A thing of shreds and patches,
     Of ballads, songs and snatches,
     And dreamy lullaby!

     My catalogue is long,
     Through every passion ranging,
     And to your humours changing
     I tune my supple song!</p>



     Enter Pooh-Bah.

     <h6>NANK.</h6> Ko-Ko, the cheap tailor, Lord High Executioner of
     Titipu! Why, that's the highest rank a citizen can attain!
     <h6>POOH.</h6> It is. Our logical Mikado, seeing no moral
     difference between the dignified judge who condemns a criminal to
     die, and the industrious mechanic who carries out the sentence,
     has rolled the two offices into one, and every judge is now his
     own executioner.
     <h6>NANK.</h6> But how good of you (for I see that you are a
     nobleman of the highest rank) to condescend to tell all this to
     me, a mere strolling minstrel!

     SONG—PISH-TUSH and CHORUS.

     <p>Our great Mikado, virtuous man,
     When he to rule our land began,
     Resolved to try
     A plan whereby
     Young men might best be steadied.

     So he decreed, in words succinct,
     That all who flirted, leered or winked
     <p>(Unless connubially linked),</p>
     Should forthwith be beheaded.</p>


     Enter Pish-Tush.

     <h6>PISH.</h6> And what may be your business with Yum-Yum?
     <h6>NANK.</h6> I'll tell you. A year ago I was a member of the
     Titipu town band. It was my duty to take the cap round for
     contributions. While discharging this delicate office, I saw
     <h6>Yum-Yum.</h6> We loved each other at once, but she was betrothed to
     her guardian Ko-Ko, a cheap tailor, and I saw that my suit was
     hopeless. Overwhelmed with despair, I quitted the town. Judge
     of my delight when I heard, a month ago, that Ko-Ko had been con-
     demned to death for flirting! I hurried back at once, in the
     hope of finding Yum-Yum at liberty to listen to my protestations.


     Enter Nanki-Poo in great excitement. He carries a native guitar
     on his back and a bundle of ballads in his hand.

     RECIT.—NANKI-POO.

     <p>Gentlemen, I pray you tell me
     Where a gentle maiden dwelleth,
     Named Yum-Yum, the ward of Ko-Ko?
     In pity speak, oh speak I pray you!

     A NOBLE. Why, who are you who ask this question? </p>
     <h6>NANK.</h6> Come gather round me, and I'll tell you.

     SONG—POOH-BAH with NANKI-POO and PISH-TUSH.

     <p>Young man, despair,
     Likewise go to,
     Yum-Yum the fair
     You must not woo.
     It will not do:
     I'm sorry for you,
     You very imperfect ablutioner!
     This very day
     From school Yum-Yum
     Will wend her way</p>


     Enter Ko-Ko and Pooh-Bah.

     <h6>KO.</h6> At last, my bride that is to be! (About to embrace
     her.)
     <h6>YUM.</h6> You're not going to kiss me before all these people?
     <h6>KO.</h6>Well, that was the idea.
     <h6>YUM</h6> <p>(aside to Peep-Bo).</p> It seems odd, doesn't it?
     <h6>PEEP.</h6> It's rather peculiar.
     <h6>PITTI.</h6> Oh, I expect it's all right. Must have a beginning,
     you know.
     <h6>YUM.</h6> Well, of course I know nothing about these things; but
     I've no objection if it's usual.
     <h6>KO.</h6> Oh, it's quite usual, I think. Eh, Lord Chamberlain?
     <p>(Appealing to Pooh-Bah.)</p>


     DUET—YUM-YUM and NANKI-POO.

     <h6>NANK.</h6><p> Were you not to Ko-Ko plighted,
          I would say in tender tone,
          "Loved one, let us be united—
          Let us be each other's own!"
          I would merge all rank and station,
          Worldly sneers are nought to us,
          And, to mark my admiration,
          I would kiss you fondly thus— (Kisses her.)
          BOTH. I/He would kiss you/me fondly thus— (Kiss.)
     <h6>YUM.</h6> But as I'm engaged to Ko-Ko,
     To embrace you thus, con fuoco,
     Would distinctly be no giuoco,
     And for yam I should get toko—

     BOTH. Toko, toko, toko, toko!</p>
