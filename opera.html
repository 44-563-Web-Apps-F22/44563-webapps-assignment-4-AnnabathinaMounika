    <pre>
                      Enter Ko-Ko.

        KO.  (looking after Yum-Yum).  There she goes!  To think how
   entirely my future happiness is wrapped up in that little parcel!
   Really, it hardly seems worth while!  Oh, matrimony!— (Enter
   Pooh-Bah and Pish-Tush.)  Now then, what is it?  Can't you see I'm
   soliloquizing?  You have interrupted an apostrophe, sir!
        PISH.  I am the bearer of a letter from his Majesty the
   Mikado.
        KO.  (taking it from him reverentially).  A letter from the
   Mikado!  What in the world can he have to say to me?  (Reads
   letter.)  Ah, here it is at last!  I thought it would come sooner
   or later!  The Mikado is struck by the fact that no executions
   have taken place in Titipu for a year, and decrees that unless
   somebody is beheaded within one month the post of Lord High
   Executioner shall be abolished, and the city reduced to the rank
   of a village!

                       Enter Nanki-Poo.

   NANK.  Yum-Yum, at last we are alone!  I have sought you
night and day for three weeks, in the belief that your guardian
was beheaded, and I find that you are about to be married to him
this afternoon!
   YUM.  Alas, yes!
   NANK.  But you do not love him?
   YUM.  Alas, no!
   NANK.  Modified rapture!  But why do you not refuse him?
   YUM.  What good would that do?  He's my guardian, and he
wouldn't let me marry you!
   NANK.  But I would wait until you were of age!
   YUM.  You forget that in Japan girls do not arrive at years
of discretion until they are fifty.
   NANK.  True; from seventeen to forty-nine are considered
years of indiscretion.


                    Enter Ko-Ko and Pooh-Bah.

KO.  At last, my bride that is to be!  (About to embrace
her.)
YUM.  You're not going to kiss me before all these people?
KO.  Well, that was the idea.
YUM (aside to Peep-Bo).  It seems odd, doesn't it?
PEEP.  It's rather peculiar.
PITTI.  Oh, I expect it's all right.  Must have a beginning,
you know.
YUM.  Well, of course I know nothing about these things; but
I've no objection if it's usual.
KO.  Oh, it's quite usual, I think.  Eh, Lord Chamberlain?
(Appealing to Pooh-Bah.)
POOH.  I have known it done.  (Ko-Ko embraces her.)


                    Enter Pooh-Bah.

       KO.  Pooh-Bah, it seems that the festivities in connection
  with my approaching marriage must last a week.  I should like to
  do it handsomely, and I want to consult you as to the amount I
  ought to spend upon them.
       POOH.  Certainly.  In which of my capacities?  As First Lord
  of the Treasury, Lord Chamberlain, Attorney General, Chancellor
  of the Exchequer, Privy Purse, or Private Secretary?
       KO.  Suppose we say as Private Secretary.
       POOH.  Speaking as your Private Secretary, I should say
  that, as the city will have to pay for it, don't stint yourself,
  do it well.
       KO.  Exactly—as the city will have to pay for it.  That is
  your advice.
       POOH.  As Private Secretary.  Of course you will understand
  that, as Chancellor of the Exchequer, I am bound to see that due
  economy is observed.


                   Enter Chorus of Nobles.

            Behold the Lord High Executioner
                 A personage of noble rank and title—
            A dignified and potent officer,
                 Whose functions are particularly vital!
                      Defer, defer,
                 To the Lord High Executioner!

                        Enter Ko-Ko attended.

                             SOLO—KO-KO.

       Taken from the county jail
            By a set of curious chances;
       Liberated then on bail,
            On my own recognizances;
       Wafted by a favouring gale
            As one sometimes is in trances,
       To a height that few can scale,
            Save by long and weary dances;
                  

                    Enter Pooh-Bah.

            NANK.  Ko-Ko, the cheap tailor, Lord High Executioner of
       Titipu! Why, that's the highest rank a citizen can attain!
            POOH.  It is.  Our logical Mikado, seeing no moral
       difference between the dignified judge who condemns a criminal to
       die, and the industrious mechanic who carries out the sentence,
       has rolled the two offices into one, and every judge is now his
       own executioner.
            NANK.  But how good of you (for I see that you are a
       nobleman of the highest rank) to condescend to tell all this to
       me, a mere strolling minstrel!


                      Enter Pish-Tush.

       PISH.  And what may be your business with Yum-Yum?
       NANK.  I'll tell you.  A year ago I was a member of the
  Titipu town band.  It was my duty to take the cap round for
  contributions.  While discharging this delicate office, I saw
  Yum-Yum.  We loved each other at once, but she was betrothed to
  her guardian Ko-Ko, a cheap tailor, and I saw that my suit was
  hopeless.  Overwhelmed with despair, I quitted the town.  Judge
  of my delight when I heard, a month ago, that Ko-Ko had been con-
  demned to death for flirting!  I hurried back at once, in the
  hope of finding Yum-Yum at liberty to listen to my protestations.


  Enter Nanki-Poo in great excitement.  He carries a native guitar
       on his back and a bundle of ballads in his hand.

                          RECIT.—NANKI-POO.

       Gentlemen, I pray you tell me
       Where a gentle maiden dwelleth,
       Named Yum-Yum, the ward of Ko-Ko?
       In pity speak, oh speak I pray you!

  A NOBLE.  Why, who are you who ask this question?
  NANK.     Come gather round me, and I'll tell you.


                Enter Ko-Ko and Pooh-Bah.

       KO.  At last, my bride that is to be!  (About to embrace
  her.)
       YUM.  You're not going to kiss me before all these people?
       KO.  Well, that was the idea.
       YUM (aside to Peep-Bo).  It seems odd, doesn't it?
       PEEP.  It's rather peculiar.
       PITTI.  Oh, I expect it's all right.  Must have a beginning,
  you know.
       YUM.  Well, of course I know nothing about these things; but
  I've no objection if it's usual.
       KO.  Oh, it's quite usual, I think.  Eh, Lord Chamberlain?
  (Appealing to Pooh-Bah.)


                   DUET—YUM-YUM and NANKI-POO.

  NANK.     Were you not to Ko-Ko plighted,
                 I would say in tender tone,
            "Loved one, let us be united—
                 Let us be each other's own!"
            I would merge all rank and station,
                 Worldly sneers are nought to us,
            And, to mark my admiration,
                 I would kiss you fondly thus— (Kisses her.)
  BOTH.     I/He would kiss you/me fondly thus— (Kiss.)
  YUM.      But as I'm engaged to Ko-Ko,
            To embrace you thus, con fuoco,
            Would distinctly be no giuoco,
            And for yam I should get toko—

  BOTH.          Toko, toko, toko, toko!
